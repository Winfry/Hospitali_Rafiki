When unmanaged, high blood sugar levels can lead to severe complications over time, impacting various organs and systems in the body, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys.By focusing on kidney health in our diabetes prediction and hospital recommendation system, we aim to support early intervention and provide valuable resources for those at risk, helping to prevent severe kidney-related issues.")
