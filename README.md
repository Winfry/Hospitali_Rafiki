# Hospitali_Rafiki

- Welcome to the NHIF-Friendly Hospitals and Dialysis Centers Recommendation System called Hospitali Rafiki. This Streamlit-based application helps users predict the likelihood of kidney disease using a trained machine learning model. Additionally, it provides hospital recommendations, specifically NHIF-friendly facilities and dialysis centers, based on the userâ€™s location and medical needs.

# Features
Kidney Disease Prediction: A predictive model assesses the likelihood of kidney disease based on user-input health information.
NHIF-Friendly Hospital and Dialysis Centers Recommendation: Recommends nearby hospitals, focusing on those registered with the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), especially those with dialysis capabilities.
Resource Tips for Kidney Health: Offers guidelines for a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise tips to manage or prevent kidney disease.

# Project Structure
App Interface: Built with Streamlit to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience.
Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model to predict the likelihood of kidney disease based on medical input data.
Hospital Data: Includes a dataset, cleaned_hospitals.csv, which stores details about NHIF-friendly hospitals and dialysis centers across counties.
Dataset
The project uses a dataset with information about NHIF-friendly hospitals and dialysis centers, containing the following columns:

- COUNTY: The county where the hospital is located.
- NHIF_OFFICE: NHIF office associated with the hospital.
- NHIF_HOSPITAL_CODE: Hospital code as per NHIF records.
- HOSPITAL_NAME: Name of the hospital.
